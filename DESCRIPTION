Description: An interactive web application for quality control,  filtering and trimming of FASTQ files. This user-friendly tool combines a pipeline for data processing  based on Biostrings and ShortRead infrastructure, with a cutting-edge visual environment.
             Single-Read and Paired-End files can be locally processed. Diagnostic interactive plots (CG content, per-base sequence quality, etc.) are provided for both the input and output files.
